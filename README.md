# Sustainable-Spending-for-Effective-Solutions
 Categorizing the expenses from Bristol dataset based on their descriptions.

In recent years there have been significant reductions in local authority funding,
and budgets have been reduced accordingly.
Cutting spending on preventative measures like early help in schools, quality of life
improvements for elderly and disabled residents, could lead to having to spend
more later to fix more severe problems as a result.
Using a sample spending dataset from a local authority, design a model to test this
theory. (Look for ‘Spend over £500’ open data).
